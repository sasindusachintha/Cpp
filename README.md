# 🧠 C++ Practice Tasks (Easy • Medium • Hard)

Welcome to my personal collection of C++ practice programs!  
This repository is organised into three difficulty levels to track my learning progress.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

📁 easy/ → Beginner-level programs: variables, input/output, loops, functions

📁 medium/ → Intermediate tasks: arrays, strings, file handling, structures

📁 hard/ → Advanced problems: pointers, dynamic memory, classes/OOP, algorithms


Each file contains a single C++ program with clear logic and comments.

## 🚀 Goals of This Repository

✔ Improve C++ programming skills  
✔ Practice solving problems step-by-step  
✔ Learn clean, readable code  
✔ Build confidence for real projects  
✔ Track progress from beginner → advanced
